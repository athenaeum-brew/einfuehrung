# Java's Garbage Collection

### Introduction
- Java simplifies memory management for developers.
  - **No need** to manually allocate or deallocate memory.
- Garbage Collection (GC):
  - Automatically removes unused objects.
  - Prevents memory leaks and out-of-memory errors.
- Why it matters:
  - Lets you focus on programming logic.
  - Reduces crashes caused by poor memory management.

### How Java References Objects
- Objects in memory are accessed via **references**.
- Code Example:
  ```java
  Cat myCat = new Cat();
  ```
  - `myCat` is a reference pointing to the `Cat` object in the heap.
- Important:
  - As long as a reference exists, the object remains in memory.
  - GC will not remove referenced objects.

### When Objects Become Unreachable
- An object becomes unreachable when:
  1. **Variable scope ends**:
     - Example: A local variable inside a method is no longer accessible after the method ends.
  2. **Reference is reassigned**:
     ```java
     myCat = new Cat();  // Original object is now unreachable.
     ```
  3. **Reference set to null**:
     ```java
     myCat = null;
     ```
     - Signals that the object is no longer needed.

### Java Memory Structure
- **Heap Memory** is divided into regions:
  - **Young Generation**:
    - Stores newly created objects.
    - Frequently garbage collected.
  - **Old Generation**:
    - Stores long-lived objects that survived multiple GC cycles.
    - Collected less often.
  - **Metaspace**:
    - Stores class metadata and method information.
- Efficient memory management:
  - Frequent GC in the Young Generation.
  - Reduced GC frequency in the Old Generation.

### Mark-and-Sweep Process
1. **Mark Phase**:
   - Identifies all objects with active references.
   - Traverses object graphs starting from roots (e.g., global variables, method stacks).
2. **Sweep Phase**:
   - Deletes objects without references.
   - Reclaims memory for new allocations.
- Simplified Visual Example:
  - Before GC: [Object A] → [Object B], [Orphan C], [Orphan D]
  - After GC: [Object A] → [Object B], Memory reclaimed for Orphan C and D.

### Optimizing Garbage Collection
- GC Efficiency:
  - Moves long-lived objects from the **Young Generation** to the **Old Generation**.
  - Focuses frequent GC on the Young Generation for quick cleanup.
- Why?
  - **Young Generation fills quickly** with transient objects.
  - Long-lived objects are less likely to be removed.
- Benefits:
  - Reduced time spent scanning old, stable objects.
  - Faster application performance.

### Coding Best Practices
- **Minimize variable scope**:
  - Declare variables only where needed.
  - Example: Use method-local variables instead of global ones.
- Avoid unnecessary object creation:
  - Reuse objects where possible (e.g., StringBuilder over concatenation).
- Use `null` intentionally:
  - Free up memory when an object is no longer needed.
- Analyze performance with tools:
  - Use profilers to identify memory usage hotspots.

### Complexity of Garbage Collection
- Other GC mechanisms:
    - e.g. [HotSpot Virtual Machine Garbage Collection](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/gctuning/available-collectors.html#GUID-F215A508-9E58-40B4-90A5-74E29BF3BD3C)
- Key takeaway:
  - Default GC settings work well for most applications.
  - Tuning is necessary only for high-performance systems.
