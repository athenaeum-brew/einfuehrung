### Introduction to Records in Java
- Records are a new addition to Java.
    - Introduced in Java 14 as a preview feature and a standard feature in Java 16 (March 16, 2021).
- They help avoid boilerplate code in specific classes.

### Background on Data Classes
- Commonly used classes to hold data.
- Example: An Employee class with fields like:
    - `String employeeName`
    - `int employeeNumber`

### A parenthesis on Java Beans

The term **Java Bean** refers to a specific convention for creating reusable software components in Java. Here are the key characteristics of Java Beans:

  1. **Encapsulation**: Java Beans typically use private fields to hold data, which can be accessed and modified through public getter and setter methods.
  2. **No-Arg Constructor**: A Java Bean should have a public no-argument constructor. 
  3. **Serializable**: Java Beans should implement the `Serializable` interface.
  4. **Property Change Support**: Java Beans often provide support for property change listeners.

**Java Beans** are more than just simple data classes; they are designed for use in frameworks and tools that rely on reflection, such as Java Server Faces (JSF).

In contrast, **records** introduced in Java 14 provide a simpler way to create data classes with less boilerplate code, focusing mainly on holding data without the additional conventions required for Java Beans.

### Implementing a Traditional Employee Class
- **Step 1:** Define private fields
- **Step 2:** Create a constructor to set fields
- **Step 3:** Generate getter methods
- **Step 4:** Override `toString`, `equals`, and `hashCode`

### Employee Class Code Example

```java
public class Employee {
    private final String name;
    private final int employeeNumber;

    public Employee(String name, int employeeNumber) {
        this.name = name;
        this.employeeNumber = employeeNumber;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getEmployeeNumber() {
        return employeeNumber;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Employee{name='" + name + "', employeeNumber=" + employeeNumber + '}';
    }

    // equals and hashCode methods...
```

### Employee Class Code Example, cont.

```java
    // ...
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        // Check if the object is the same reference
        if (this == obj) {
            return true;
        }
        // Check if the object is an instance of Employee
        if (!(obj instanceof Employee)) {
            return false;
        }
        // Cast the object to Employee and compare fields
        Employee other = (Employee) obj;
        return employeeNumber == other.employeeNumber && 
                (name != null ? name.equals(other.name) : other.name == null);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        int result = name != null ? name.hashCode() : 0;
        result = 31 * result + employeeNumber;
        return result;
    }
}
```

### The Challenge of Boilerplate Code
- Traditional classes can lead to verbose code.
- Example: The Employee class can exceed 50 lines for simple data handling.
- Implementing hashCode() and equals() correctly can be challenging.

### Introducing Records
- Records are a simplified way to create data-carrying classes.
- Example of a record declaration:
```java
public record EmployeeRecord(String name, int employeeNumber) {}
```

---

# Java Records

### Benefits of Using Records
- Automatically provides:
  - Private final fields
  - Public getter methods
  - `toString`, `equals`, and `hashCode` implementations
- Immutability: Records are immutable by default.

### Example Code Using Records
```java
public record EmployeeRecord(String name, int employeeNumber) {}

// Usage:
EmployeeRecord employee = new EmployeeRecord("Kramer", 54321);
```

### Understanding Record Constructors
- Canonical constructor automatically generated.
- Allows parameter validation.
- Compact constructor: simplified syntax for custom constructor.

---

# Java Records

### Advanced Record Properties

- **Instance and Static Methods**: Records can include both types of methods.

- **Field Restrictions**:
  - **No Extra Instance Fields**: Only the fields you declare in the record are allowed.
  - **Why?**: This maintains immutability and keeps the design straightforward.

- **Inheritance**:
  - **No Class Extensions**: Records cannot extend other classes; they implicitly extend `java.lang.Record`.
  - **Why?**: This design choice enhances simplicity and usability.

- **Interface Implementation**: Records can implement interfaces, allowing for flexibility in usage.

### Additional Use Cases for Records

- Local Records in Methods
   - Records can be defined within methods, enabling the creation of temporary data structures without cluttering the global namespace.
   
```java
public void process() {
    record Point(int x, int y) {}
    Point p = new Point(1, 2);
    System.out.println(p);
}
```

### Conclusion
- Records streamline data management in Java.
- Reduce boilerplate code and enhance readability.
- Ideal for data-holding classes.
