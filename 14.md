# Java Testing

## What is Unit Testing?
Unit testing is a technique used to verify the smallest parts of an application, such as methods or functions, in isolation. 

### Purpose:
- Ensure individual components behave as expected.
- Validate logic without dependencies on other parts of the system.

### Benefits:
- Catch bugs early during development.
- Facilitate safe refactoring of code.
- Provide living documentation for developers.

## JUnit 5 Overview
JUnit 5 is the modern version of the JUnit testing framework for Java.

### Key Features:
- **Modular Architecture**: Built with the JUnit Platform, Jupiter, and Vintage modules.
- **Modern Java Support**: Fully compatible with Java 8+ features such as lambdas and streams.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Supports tests written for JUnit 4.

## Setting Up JUnit 5
To use JUnit 5 in your project, you need to add the appropriate dependency to your build tool.

### Maven Configuration:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
  <version>5.10.0</version>
</dependency>
```

---
# Java Testing

## Test Lifecycle
JUnit 5 provides annotations to manage the lifecycle of your tests.

### Common Annotations:
- `@BeforeEach`: Runs before each test method.
- `@AfterEach`: Runs after each test method.
- `@BeforeAll`: Runs once before all tests in the class.
- `@AfterAll`: Runs once after all tests in the class.

---
# Java Testing

## Writing Your First Test
A simple test using JUnit 5 involves creating a method annotated with `@Test`.

### Example:
```java
@Test
void testAddition() {
    int result = 1 + 1;
    assertEquals(2, result, "1 + 1 should equal 2");
}
```

This ensures the addition logic behaves as expected.

---
# Java Testing

## @Test and Assertions
JUnit 5 provides several assertions to verify the behavior of code.

### Common Assertions:
- `assertEquals(expected, actual)`: Check if two values are equal.
- `assertNotNull(object)`: Ensure an object is not null.
- `assertThrows(exception, code)`: Verify an exception is thrown.

---
# Java Testing

## @ParameterizedTest
Parameterized tests allow you to run the same test logic with different inputs.

### Example:
```java
@ParameterizedTest
@ValueSource(ints = {1, 2, 3})
void testWithMultipleInputs(int number) {
    assertTrue(number > 0, "Number should be positive");
}
```

This test will run three times with inputs 1, 2, and 3.

---
# Java Testing

## @DisplayName and Tags
Use these annotations to improve test readability and organization.

### Examples:
- `@DisplayName`: Provides a custom name for your test.
- `@Tag`: Assigns a tag for grouping tests (e.g., `@Tag("fast")`).

---
# Java Testing

## @Disabled
You can disable tests temporarily using the `@Disabled` annotation.

### Example:
```java
@Disabled("Feature under development")
@Test
void testFeatureX() {
    // Code here
}
```

---
# Java Testing

## @Nested Tests
Nested tests help organize related tests hierarchically.

### Example:
```java
@Nested
class MathOperationsTest {
    @Test
    void testAddition() {
        assertEquals(4, 2 + 2);
    }
}
```

---
# Java Testing

## Dynamic Tests
Dynamic tests are generated at runtime using `@TestFactory`.

### Example:
```java
@TestFactory
Collection<DynamicTest> dynamicTestsFromIntStream() {
    return IntStream.range(1, 5)
        .mapToObj(n -> DynamicTest.dynamicTest("Test " + n, () -> assertTrue(n > 0)))
        .toList();
}
```

---
# Java Testing

## Assertions in Depth
JUnit 5 assertions allow for better messages and timeout control.

### Example:
```java
assertEquals(5, result, "Expected the result to be 5");
assertTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(1), () -> {
    // Code that should complete within 1 second
});
```

---
# Java Testing

## Mocking Dependencies
Mocks help test components in isolation by simulating behavior.

### Example (Using Mockito):
```java
when(mockService.getData()).thenReturn("Mock Data");
assertEquals("Mock Data", mockService.getData());
```

---
# Java Testing

## Testing Edge Cases
Always ensure edge cases are covered.

### Examples:
- Empty inputs.
- Large or invalid values.
- Boundary conditions.

---
# Java Testing

## Avoiding Flaky Tests
Flaky tests fail inconsistently due to external factors like timing or state.

### Solutions:
- Mock external dependencies.
- Ensure consistent state before running tests.

---
# Java Testing

## Clean Test Code
Readable and maintainable tests improve collaboration and debugging.

### Best Practices:
- Use descriptive names for test methods.
- Keep tests focused on a single behavior.

---
# Java Testing

## Testing a Simple Application
### Example:
Write unit tests for a Calculator class, focusing on addition and subtraction.

```java
@Test
void testAddition() {
    assertEquals(5, calculator.add(2, 3));
}
```

---
# Java Testing

## Handling Exceptions
Test how your code handles errors.

### Example:
```java
@Test
void testInvalidInput() {
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> calculator.divide(10, 0));
}
```

---
# Java Testing

## Testing Service Layer
Use mocks to isolate service logic from the database.

### Example:
```java
when(repository.findById(1)).thenReturn(Optional.of(mockEntity));
assertEquals("Expected Data", service.getData(1));
```

---
# Java Testing

## What is Integration Testing?
Integration tests verify that components interact correctly.

### Example:
- Testing a REST controller with its service and repository.

---
# Java Testing

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls
- Use mocks where necessary to avoid unstable environments.
- Keep dependencies in integration tests consistent.

---
# Java Testing

## Performance Testing
Performance tests ensure code meets speed and scalability requirements.

### Example with JMH:
```java
@Benchmark
public void testMethod() {
    // Code to benchmark
}
```

---
# Java Testing

## Summary
- **Unit Tests**: Focus on individual components.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify how components work together.
- **Other Tests**: Performance, security, and end-to-end.
