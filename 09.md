# Packages, <u>Classpath</u> & Jars

### What is the Classpath?
- The classpath is a setting in Java that tells the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) where to look for user-defined classes and packages when running a Java program.
- It can include:
  - **Directories** with compiled class files (`.class`)
  - **JAR files** (Java ARchive files) containing libraries
  - **Other paths** where dependencies are located

### Why is the Classpath Important?
- The JVM needs to find all classes used in your program.
- If a class isn’t in the classpath, you will get a `ClassNotFoundException` or similar errors.
- By setting the classpath, you ensure the JVM knows where to search for your classes and libraries.

### How is the Classpath Set?
- **Default classpath**: The current directory (`.`) is the default classpath.
- **Manually set classpath**: You can set the classpath manually using:
  - The `-cp` or `-classpath` option when running a Java program:
    ```bash
    java -cp path/to/classes MainClass
    ```
  - The environment variable `CLASSPATH` (less common but useful for global settings):
    ```bash
    export CLASSPATH=path/to/classes
    ```

### What Can You Include in the Classpath?
- **Multiple Paths**: Separate paths with colons (`:`) on Linux/Mac or semicolons (`;`) on Windows:
  ```bash
  java -cp path1:path2:myjar.jar MainClass
  ```
- **JAR files**: JAR files bundle multiple classes. They can be included like:
  ```bash
  java -cp mylib.jar MainClass
  ```
- **Wildcard (`*`)**: To include all JAR files in a directory:
  ```bash
  java -cp 'lib/*' MainClass
  ```

### Common Classpath Errors
- **ClassNotFoundException**: The JVM couldn’t find the class you tried to load.
- **NoClassDefFoundError**: The class was found at compile time but not at runtime.
  
  **Tip**: Always ensure all paths and JARs required by your program are included in the classpath!

### Best Practices
- Keep it simple! Use the `-cp` option rather than setting the environment variable `CLASSPATH` globally.
- Organize your files: Place your `.class` files and JARs in a known directory and include only what you need.
- Use IDEs: Integrated Development Environments (like IntelliJ, Eclipse) automatically manage the classpath for you!

# <u>Packages</u>, Classpath & Jars

### **What is a Java Package?**
- A **package** is a way to organize related classes and interfaces in Java.
- It provides a **namespace** to avoid name conflicts between classes.
- Packages help structure your code in a logical manner.
  
  **Example**:  
  ```java
  package com.example.myapp;
  
  public class MyClass { 
      // Code here 
  }
  ```
  - The class `MyClass` is part of the `com.example.myapp` package.

### **Why Use Packages?**
- **Organization**: Group related classes together (e.g., utilities, models, services).
- **Access Control**: Packages help control visibility of classes and methods using `public`, `protected`, and `private`.
- **Reusability**: Reuse common packages across different projects or parts of a project.

### **How Packages and the Classpath Work Together**
- The **classpath** tells Java where to find the compiled `.class` files for your program.
- Each package corresponds to a **directory structure** in the classpath.

  **Example**:  
  If the class `com.example.myapp.MyClass` is in a file, its location on disk should be:
  ```bash
  /path/to/classes/com/example/myapp/MyClass.class
  ```
  The `/path/to/classes` directory should be in your classpath.

### **Using Packages in Your Code**
- When you use classes from a package, you need to **import** them.
  
  **Example**:
  ```java
  import com.example.myapp.MyClass;

  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          MyClass obj = new MyClass();
      }
  }
  ```

- The Java compiler and JVM will search the classpath for `com/example/myapp/MyClass.class`.

### **Setting Classpath for Packaged Classes**
- Ensure the **root folder** of your package structure is in the classpath.

  **Example**:
  ```bash
  java -cp /path/to/classes Main
  ```
  If `Main.java` uses `com.example.myapp.MyClass`, the JVM will look for:
  ```bash
  /path/to/classes/com/example/myapp/MyClass.class
  ```

### **Summary: Packages and Classpath**
- **Packages** organize your code.
- **Classpath** tells Java where to find the code.
- Correctly organizing your class files and setting the classpath ensures that the JVM can locate and load the right classes.

# Packages, Classpath & <u>Jars</u>

### **What is a JAR File?**
- A **JAR (Java ARchive)** is a compressed file format that bundles multiple `.class` files and resources (like images or text files) into one file.
- JAR files make it easier to distribute and share Java applications or libraries.
  
  **Example**:  
  ```bash
  myapp.jar
  ```

- Inside, the JAR contains directories matching your package structure:
  ```bash
  com/example/myapp/MyClass.class
  ```

### **Why Use JAR Files?**
- **Convenience**: Bundles everything into a single file for easier distribution.
- **Efficiency**: Faster class loading and reduced file size due to compression.
- **Modularity**: Useful for organizing libraries or entire applications into one file.

### **Creating a JAR File**
- You can create a JAR using the `jar` command. Example:
  ```bash
  jar cvf myapp.jar -C path/to/classes .
  ```
  - `c` = create a new JAR
  - `v` = verbose output (shows details)
  - `f` = specify the JAR file name
  - `-C` = changes to the directory to include files from
  
  This command packages all files from `path/to/classes` into `myapp.jar`.

### **Running a JAR File**
- If a JAR file contains an executable program (with a `main` method), you can run it directly:
  ```bash
  java -jar myapp.jar
  ```
  - The JAR must include a `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file that specifies the `Main-Class` to run.

  **Example** of `MANIFEST.MF`:
  ```bash
  Main-Class: com.example.myapp.Main
  ```

### **Using JARs in the Classpath**
- You can include JAR files in the classpath when running your program:
  ```bash
  java -cp myapp.jar MainClass
  ```
- You can also include multiple JAR files by separating them with colons (`:`) on Linux/Mac or semicolons (`;`) on Windows:
  ```bash
  java -cp lib1.jar:lib2.jar MainClass
  ```

### **Best Practices with JAR Files**
- Use JARs to keep your project organized by bundling your class files and resources.
- Use **build tools** like Maven or Gradle to automate JAR creation and manage external libraries.
- Always include the necessary JARs in the classpath when running your Java programs.

### **JARs, Packages, and Classpath: The Big Picture**
- **Packages** organize your classes.
- **Classpath** tells the JVM where to find classes and libraries.
- **JARs** package everything into a single, compressed file for easy sharing and deployment.
