# Einführung in die Programmierung

I asked ChatGPT to explain me why ChatGPT is good:

--

*"AI is transforming software engineering by automating repetitive tasks, improving code quality, and accelerating development. With tools like ChatGPT, developers can quickly generate code, debug, and find solutions to complex problems, significantly reducing development time. AI also assists in optimizing algorithms, enhancing user experiences, and providing real-time guidance, making programming more efficient and accessible. This revolution allows developers to focus more on creative problem-solving and innovation."*
