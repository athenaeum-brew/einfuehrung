# Debugging Java Programs

## A simple Java program

```java
import java.util.List;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        List<String> strings = List.of("a", "b", "c");

        for (String str : strings) {
            System.out.println(str);
        }

    }
}
```

---

## Configuring the Debugger
- Use a `launch.json` file for debugging setups:
  - Allows multiple debugging configurations.
  - Stores debugging setup details.

---

## Example `launch.json`
```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "java",
      "name": "Debug (Launch)",
      "request": "launch",
      "mainClass": "com.example.Main"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Customizing the Debugger
- Use IntelliSense for attributes:
  - Press `Ctrl + Space` to view suggestions.
- Choose Debug Modes:
  - **Launch Mode**: Debug from the start.
  - **Attach Mode**: Attach to a running program.

---

## What Are Breakpoints?
- Breakpoints are intentional pauses in code execution.
- Types of breakpoints:
  - **Simple Breakpoints**: Pause at a specific line.
  - **Conditional Breakpoints**: Pause only when a condition is met.
  - **Log Points**: Output values without pausing.

---

## Simple Breakpoints
---

## Conditional Breakpoints
- Pause only when a condition is true.

---

## Log Points
- Log Points output variable values in the debug console.
- They do not pause program execution.

---

## Debugger Tools: Buttons
- **Continue**: Jump to the next breakpoint or finish the program.
- **Step Over**: Execute the current line and move to the next.
- **Step Into**: Enter a function or method being called.
- **Step Out**: Exit the current function in one step.
- **Restart**: Restart the debugger.
- **Stop**: End the debugging session.

---

## Debugging Variables
- View variables in the Debug panel:
  - Local variables become visible after execution.

---

## Modifying Variables During Debugging
- Use the Debug Console to test variable changes.
- Example:
  - Modify `i` during a loop:
    - Set `i = 10` and continue execution.
    - Observe how the program reacts to the new value.

---

## Using Step Features
- **Step Over**:
  - Executes a line without entering called functions.
- **Step Into**:
  - Enters a function to see what happens inside.
- **Step Out**:
  - Jumps out of the current function to its caller.

---

## Wrapping Up
- Debugging tools in Visual Studio Code:
  - Breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, and log points.
  - Debug Console for variable testing.
  - Step Over, Step Into, Step Out for line-by-line control.
