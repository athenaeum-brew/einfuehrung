## Introduction to Exceptions

Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.

They are important for handling unexpected situations and errors gracefully.

Types of exceptions in Java:

- **Checked exceptions**: These are checked at compile time and must be handled explicitly by the programmer.
- **Unchecked exceptions**, or Runtime exceptions: These are not checked at compile time and usually indicate programming errors or unexpected conditions.
- **Errors**: Serious problems that cannot be handled by the application, such as out-of-memory errors or system failures.

## Introduction to Exceptions

#### Exception Handling Strategies

Handling exceptions with try-catch blocks:

- The try-catch block is used to handle exceptions by enclosing the code that might throw an exception within a try block and providing catch blocks to handle specific types of exceptions.

The finally block for cleanup and resource management:

- The finally block is used to execute cleanup code that should be run regardless of whether an exception occurs or not, such as releasing resources or closing files.

Exception propagation: how exceptions propagate through method calls:

- When an exception is thrown inside a method, it can be propagated up the call stack to the calling method if not caught and handled locally. This allows for centralized exception handling at higher levels of the application.

## Exception Handling Techniques for File I/O

#### Reading from files and Handling Exceptions:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExampleWithExceptions {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BufferedReader reader = null;
        try {
            reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example-read.txt"));
            int data;
            while ((data = reader.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) data);
            }
            System.out.println();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // e.printStackTrace();
            System.out.println("Here I MUST handle the exception !");
        } finally {
            if (reader != null) {
                try {
                    reader.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note how resources management is cumbersome.

## Exception Handling Techniques for File I/O

#### Using try-with-resources for automatic resource management

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExampleWithExceptions {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example-read.txt"))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
