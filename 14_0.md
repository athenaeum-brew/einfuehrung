# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##What is Unit Testing?
- Purpose: Test individual components in isolation.
- Benefits:
  - Catch bugs early.
  - Facilitate refactoring.
  - Provide documentation.

# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##Setting Up JUnit 5
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
  <version>5.10.0</version>
</dependency>
```

##Test Lifecycle
- `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`: Run before/after each test.
- `@BeforeAll`, `@AfterAll`: Run once before/after all tests.

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##Writing Your First Test
```java
@Test
void testAddition() {
    assertEquals(2, 1 + 1);
}
```

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##@Test and Assertions
- `assertEquals`, `assertNotNull`, `assertTrue`.
- `assertThrows`: For testing exceptions.

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##@ParameterizedTest
```java
@ParameterizedTest
@ValueSource(ints = {1, 2, 3})
void testWithMultipleInputs(int number) {
    assertTrue(number > 0);
}
```

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##@DisplayName and Tags
- `@DisplayName`: Custom names for tests.
- `@Tag`: Grouping tests (e.g., `@Tag("slow")`).

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##@Disabled
- Temporarily skip tests.
- Example: `@Disabled("Under development")`.

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##@Nested Tests
- Organizing related tests hierarchically.

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##Dynamic Tests
- Use `@TestFactory` for programmatically generated tests.

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##Assertions in Depth
- Custom messages for better readability.
```java
assertEquals(5, result, "Result should be 5");
```

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##Mocking Dependencies
- Use Mockito to mock services and repositories.
```java
when(mockService.getData()).thenReturn("Mock Data");
```

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##Testing Edge Cases
- Example: Testing empty inputs, large values, invalid data.

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##Avoiding Flaky Tests
- Common causes: Dependencies on external state, timing issues.
- Solutions: Isolate tests, mock dependencies.

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##Clean Test Code
- Use descriptive test method names.
- Follow consistent formatting.

---

##Testing a Simple Application
- A Calculator class example with addition and subtraction.

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##Handling Exceptions
- Write tests for invalid input and ensure proper error messages.

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##Testing Service Layer
- Use mocks to simulate database or external API interactions.

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##Review
- Key takeaways from unit testing.

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##What is Integration Testing?
- Testing how components work together.
- Example: Controller + Service + Repository.

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##Purpose and Challenges
- Identify interaction issues.
- Ensure end-to-end functionality.

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##When to Use Integration Tests
- Validating REST endpoints.
- Ensuring database queries are correct.

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##Testing REST APIs
- Use MockMVC for testing controllers.
```java
mockMvc.perform(get("/api/resource"))
       .andExpect(status().isOk());
```

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##Database Integration Tests
- Use H2 in-memory database for testing persistence logic.

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##Messaging Systems
- Example: Kafka or RabbitMQ producers/consumers.

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##Testing External APIs
- Use WireMock to mock API responses.

---
# Java Testing: Unit, Integration, and Beyond

##Spring Boot Testing Utilities
- `@SpringBootTest`, `TestEntityManager`.

---
